My name is Scott McCain, I'm a Damon Runyon Postdoctoral Fellow, co-advised by Dr. Gene-Wei Li at MIT in the Department of Biology and Dr. Mick Follows in 
the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. I am interested in how microbes can transform the environments they live in (from inside 
the human gut, to large-scale ocean processes) and how to model these complex processes. I specifically use a combination of 
mathematical modelling, *in situ* observations of gene expression in complex communities (metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics), and culture-based 
experiments using model (and non-model!) bacteria to tackle these questions. I'm particularly interested in connecting processes at the 
level of gene expression to cellular and ecological outcomes.

During my PhD, I mostly studied photosynthetic, surface-dwelling marine microbes. I used a combination of *in situ* observations (metaproteomics and 
metatranscriptomics), and mathematical modelling, to explore how microbes behave. My PhD was been centered on understanding how trace metals like iron and 
manganese influence microbial proteomes, and in turn, impact large-scale biogeochemical processes in the ocean. 

I did my undergraduate at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/), and worked with [Dr. Charlie Trick](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/directory/faculty/trick.html) on harmful algal blooms and bio-optics. I then moved to Halifax to work with [Dr. Heike Lotze](http://lotzelab.biology.dal.ca/) studying historical marine ecology and fisheries. I had a brief stint with [Dr. Chris Taggart](http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/) in the Oceanography Department at Dalhousie as a research assistant, and then completed a PhD with [Dr. Erin Bertrand](http://erinbertrand.blogspot.ca/) at Dalhousie University in the [Department of Biology](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/biology.html).
