My name is Scott McCain, I'm a Damon Runyon Postdoctoral Fellow, co-advised by Dr. Gene-Wei Li at MIT in the Department of Biology and Dr. Mick Follows in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and 
Planetary Sciences. I am interested in how microbes live in the wild (from the gut to the deep ocean), and how they influence the environments they live in (from human 
health to ocean biogeochemistry). I specifically 
use a combination of 
mathematical modelling, in situ observations, and culture-based experiments to tackle these broad questions. I'm particularly interested in connecting processes at the 
level of gene expression to cellular and ecological outcomes.

During my PhD, I mostly studied photosynthetic, surface-dwelling marine microbes. I used a combination of *in situ* observations (metaproteomics and 
metatranscriptomics), and mathematical modelling, to explore how microbes behave. My PhD was been centered on understanding how trace metals like iron and manganese influence microbial proteomes, and in turn, impact biogeochemical processes in the ocean. 

A lot of my work has used mass spectrometry, but I've found using published datasets to be very fruitful ([this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31483995/) of ours was entirely conducted on data from >10 previously published papers!). I also spend a considerable amount of time studying bias in observations, with a strong focus on metaproteomic observations.

I have diverse interests, and have also done some consulting work in the cannabis industry. I specifically worked on science communication challenges, translating research on cannabidiol efficacy, and assessing bioavailability of natural products.

I did my undergraduate at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/), and worked with [Dr. Charlie Trick](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/directory/faculty/trick.html) on harmful algal blooms and bio-optics. I then moved to Halifax to work with [Dr. Heike Lotze](http://lotzelab.biology.dal.ca/) studying historical marine ecology and fisheries. I had a brief stint with [Dr. Chris Taggart](http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/) in the Oceanography Department at Dalhousie as a research assistant, and then completed a PhD with [Dr. Erin Bertrand](http://erinbertrand.blogspot.ca/) at Dalhousie University in the [Department of Biology](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/biology.html).
