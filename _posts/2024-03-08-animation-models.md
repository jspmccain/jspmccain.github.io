title: animation is like modelling biology

Disney’s [“Twelve basic principles of 
animation”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation) 
outline the basic characteristics of good animation. 

1.	Squash and stretch
2.	Anticipation
3.	Staging
4.	Straight ahead action and pose to pose
5.	Follow through and overlapping action
6.	Slow in and slow out
7.	Arc
8.	Secondary Action
9.	Timing
10.	Exaggeration
11.	Solid drawing
12.	Appeal

I think there are some parallels between animation and modelling biology, 
and I wonder how these twelve basic principles for ‘good’ animation are 
similar to ‘good’ models. (Note: ‘good’ is a function of the 
user/observer, and will change from person to person! Some people like CGI 
animation, others like the Lion King.)

I like models that distill a key feature of biology, usually representing 
a feature with a set of equations. For example, how interactions between 
organisms can be distilled to their shared use of resources (Resource 
Ratio Theory), or how nutrient uptake can be represented as an extension 
of enzyme kinetics (e.g., from Aksnes and Egge, 1991). Animations are 
similar, their goal isn’t to perfectly represent the actual humans or 
characters. One goal of animation is to highlight salient features, 
perhaps to ultimately triggering our emotions.

The same is true in models of biology. Models can be used to capture the 
salient features of a biological system. Instead of triggering our 
emotions, we can use models to clarify and quantify our understanding of a 
system. They will never capture all the details!

What can we learn from these twelve principles of animation, to improve 
mathematical models of biology? There are several categories of animation 
principles that I’ll try to distill. 

1)	Physics-based rules: Squash and stretch; Follow through; Arc; 
Secondary Action

“Squash and stretch” is a basic principle where objects squash once they 
hit another surface. The classic example / animation exercise is a ball 
dropping. “Arc” represents gravity – characters flying through the air 
should arc, rather than go along a single straight line. Aesthetically, 
animations missing these principles simply just look off. It’s hard to 
articulate precisely why, but comparing two animations without these basic 
attributes, I’ve found that there is a clear winner.

What are these basic principles that models in biology should adhere to? 
Some write that there are ‘first principles’ in biology – what are they? 
Why are they first, and not second? I’d argue that conservation of mass is 
a good place to start, and maybe also diffusion. I’m tempted to say that 
another basic principle is that all things are selfish, in an evolutionary 
sense. I’m not sure there are simplifying/unifying principles in biology, 
the way they exist in physics (or at least as I’ve heard they exist in 
physics!). I would love to hear what others think: which key features 
should models in biology adhere to?

2)	Aesthetic-based rules: Solid drawing, Slow in and slow out, 
Anticipation

Should certain models be considered better because they are more 
aesthetic? What does it mean for a model to be more aesthetic? I’ve heard 
that in math, some people strongly prefer elegant or beautiful proofs 
(e.g., [this paper](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2007-44-04/S0273-0979-07-01168-8/S0273-0979-07-01168-8.pdf)). 
I think this is just unavoidable in some ways. A simpler model, that 
achieves the same thing as a more complicated model, might be considered 
more aesthetic (?). But if it’s simpler, by definition, it should be more 
interpretable. I don’t necessarily think a good model means it’s more 
aesthetic, but maybe there’s some correlation there.

At the risk of killing the potential connection between animation and 
modelling, I’ll stop the comparison here. Would love to hear others 
thoughts, if anyone ever reads this.
